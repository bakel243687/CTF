The Buckeye CTF has ended and I could not do much. Oh well, we go again another time. In the meantime, these are the task I could do.

Mystery text
This task involved a .txt file which had a combination of (+-><[].). I've come across this before and realized that is is Brain Fuck code. You can read on it later, I wasn't the one that gave a programming language that name.

The task was simple, Decodes the message.

I went to an online compiler for the language as I haven't setup mine. Upon running the code, I got a long hex string as output which upon decryption with Cybershef, I got a base64 cipher which I still did to Cyberchef
